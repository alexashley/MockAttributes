See [MovieFinderTest](https://github.com/alexashley/MockAttributes/blob/master/MockAttributes.Demo/MovieFinderTest.cs) for a usage example

TODO:

- [x] inject mocks into test
- [ ] inject mocked objects into class under test (for `Moq` initially, although could be made more general)
- [ ] stand-up class-under-test with mocked objects
