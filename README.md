# MockAttributes
Mockito-like annotations for .NET

See [MovieFinderTest](https://github.com/alexashley/MockAttributes/blob/master/MockAttributes.Demo/MovieFinderTest.cs) for a usage example


### WIP
- [x] inject mocks into test
- [x] inject mocked objects into class under test (for `Moq` initially, although could be made more general)
- [x] stand-up class-under-test with mocked objects
- [ ] better test suite than the demo
- [ ] suppress CS0649 ("Field is never assigned to, and will always have its default value null")
- [ ] support properties?
