# MockAttributes
Mockito-like annotations for .NET

See [MovieFinderTest](https://github.com/alexashley/MockAttributes/blob/master/MockAttributes.Demo/MovieFinderTest.cs) for a usage example

TODO:

- [x] inject mocks into test
- [x] inject mocked objects into class under test (for `Moq` initially, although could be made more general)
- [x] stand-up class-under-test with mocked objects
- [ ] better test suite than the demo
